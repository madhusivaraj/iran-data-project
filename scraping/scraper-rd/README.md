* `original-captcha` - Code provided by Denise and Mark to beat the Captcha
* `node-scraper-testing` - Rudimentary test to see if finding code parameters (that uniquely identify an article) given BusinessIDs was feasible... It's not
* `initial-findings` - Preliminary findings, experiments, and code related to the solving and bypassing of CAPTCHA's to obtain documents
* `tor-poc` - A proof of concept demonstrating the viability of two different ways of using Tor to mask and rotate IP addresses during scraping
